# Learning Godot
This repo contains all of my code and project files made while working through the official Godot tutorials for both the [2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) and [3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) examples.

All work was done with Godot 4.3 in GDScript.
